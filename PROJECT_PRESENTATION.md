# Project Name

Testing The Traitors 🕵🏻

## Overview

Our project is based on murder mystery game show The Traitors.

We've written a series of coding puzzles themed around tracking down Traitors and helping fellow Faithfuls. The goal is to help you practice your coding skills in a fun and engaging way, putting your problem solving skills to the test and embracing the detective mindset 🔎

## Instructions

TASK ONE 🎭

TASK TWO 🎭
Last night, one of the faithfuls met their fate. But before they were killed, they left behind a clue as to who the murderous traitor might be - a scroll of parchment with some mysterious code written on it:

"hL2I@k4jjA7zD98n6L!L1mFhP!aVh3X4a8e9R92sYtkdZ#8Fi!P-87cr78ngL1i8n9d6aT3w7tX9L1"

Write a function to decipher the code and find the name of the traitor.

Here is a list of all the potential traitors identified so far by the faithfuls to help you - "Alexander", "Leanne", "Linda", "Frankie".
