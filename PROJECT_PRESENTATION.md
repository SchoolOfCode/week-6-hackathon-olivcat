# Project Name

Testing The Traitors üïµüèª

## Overview

Our project is based on murder mystery game show The Traitors.

We've written a series of coding puzzles themed around tracking down Traitors and helping fellow Faithfuls. The goal is to help you practice your coding skills in a fun and engaging way, putting your problem solving skills to the test and embracing the detective mindset üîé

## Instructions

TASK TWO üé≠
Last night, one of the faithfuls met their fate. But before they were killed, they left behind a clue as to who the murdererous traitor might be - a scroll of parchment with some mysterious code written on it:

"hL2I@k4jjA7zD98n6L!L1mFhP!aVh3X4a8e9R92sYtkdZ#8Fi!P-87cr78ngL1i8n9d6aT3w7tX9L1"

Write a function to decipher the code and find the name of the traitor.

Here is a list of all the potential traitors indentified so far by the faithfuls to help you - "Alexander", "Leanne", "Linda", "Frankie".

## Planning Phase

### Project Requirements

- Creating a coding puzzle to be solved, in line with our theme
- Writing unit tests to check whether the user's solution to the task is correct

### Resources

- Team members and roles
- Budget allocation
- Required tools and technologies

## Brainstorming

### Ideas & Concepts

1. Aims

- Come up with a problem that attaches to something tangible/real life
- Have a story/theme behind our katas so they feel linked and cohesive

2. Second major concept
   - Supporting details
   - Potential challenges
   - Implementation approaches

### Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution          | Status   |
| --------- | ----------------- | -------- |
| Issue 1   | Approach taken    | Resolved |
| Issue 2   | Proposed solution | Pending  |

## Results & Analysis

## User Feedback & Testimonials

Let us know what you thought of our project! Feedback welcome.

## Stretch Goals

- Add hints for if users are struggling to find a solution
- Develop the story of the game and continue building tasks to form a narrative
- Add a Front end
- Test end-to-end with Playwright
